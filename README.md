	Project Description:
  The purpose of this project is the detection of smoke and natural gas leaks. Smoke or natural gas leakage is a serious problem that can significantly impact human life and even cause death. At the same time, when people are not at home, but gas leakage occurs, we aimed to create a solution for early intervention to prevent incidents like explosions. Additionally, the system will inform the landlord and relevant authorities in a timely manner for natural gas leak emergency situations.

The system to be used in the project will include sensors to detect smoke and natural gas leaks. These sensors will generate an alert when smoke or gas leakage is detected, which will be sent to the user's smartphone. Simultaneously, automatic notification will be sent to the relevant authorities in the location where the system is installed.
Furthermore, it is crucial to securely store the data collected by the system. Therefore, it will ensure that the collected data is securely stored in a cloud-based storage service. This will facilitate data protection and ensure accessibility when needed.
